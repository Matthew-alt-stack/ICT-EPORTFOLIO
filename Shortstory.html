            <p class="stanza">Once there was a race going on. A tortoise and a hare participated when the hare started to run faster.</p>
            <p class="stanza">After a while, the hare stopped and looked back. He couldn't find the tortoise anywhere. He thought that the tortoise was lagging. So he sleep under the tree.</p>
            <p class="stanza">When he woke up, he couldn't see the tortoise. He started to run again towards the final point. But when he got there, he was surprised. The race was already finished.</p>
            <p class="stanza">The tortoise had reached there before him. The tortoise had won the game, even though he was the slowest one.</p>
