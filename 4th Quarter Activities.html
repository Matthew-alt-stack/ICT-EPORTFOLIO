This project was given to us in the worst possible time since the hell week has lots of summative and other output that is deadline.

This is one of the best PT since it reminds me of Ibong Adarna play. We had lots of fights but we resolve it as a section. Even though we got stress, im glad that we got stress as a section, and we'll overcome those challenges as a section. We got more closer and had fun. </font> </td>

We got problems on who to follow since our group was seperate into 2 side. Even though that happened, we still crammed it and our performance went well. THe practice and pressure of this PT is insane. Its so tiring but worth it.   </font> </td>

It was harder for me because i couldn't find a place that is quiet and I look like an idiot videoing myself. I'll probably get a low score cause all the noise and not a good performance but atleast its done. </font> </td>

I love the perfomance of our section aswell as faith and family. They were really good and i couldnt imagine how much effort and time that took. The dances went well and I wish that it lasted a bit longer since it was so good.   </font> </td>
